# College-Network-Simulation
Simulation of a Secure Institutional LAN Network in CISCO Packet Tracer.

# Description
This project was completed as a part of the virtual internship offered by CISCO. With the help of CISCO Packet Tracer, we were able to simulate the network architectural design of a typical internal institutional network. The network activities were simulated between various departments and independent machines and a report was generated on how to improve the latency of communication between any two nodes.

# Technologies Used
CISCO Packet Tracer for simulation
